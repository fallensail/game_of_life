=====
This project demonstrate the implementation of Conway's Game of Life. There are 4 buttons on the UI page. Namely: 
-"Start": to initiate the simulation with the given settings on the board
-"Clear": pause the simulation if there is any, and clear all the dots on the board
-"Initialize with Guns": pause the simulation if there is any, and clear all the dots on the board and initialize the board with Gosper Gun
-"Stop": puase the simulation

Besides the design of buttons, users can also click the squares to edit the cells condition. Click the empty square will activate the cell, the colored one will degenerate the cell. Please noted users can only change the conditions when the game is not undergoing simulation.
